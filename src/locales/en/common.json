      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "subtitle": "Find answers to common questions about NIStego and how it can help you succeed",
      "q1": "How does NIStego transform my learning experience?",
      "a1": "NIStego revolutionizes learning by combining AI analysis, goal management, progress tracking, and personalized recommendations. We help you learn smarter, not harder — you know what you're learning, why, and how to improve it.",
      "q2": "Will NIStego help me prepare for exams?",
      "a2": "Absolutely. The platform offers personalized preparation plans, AI-powered error analysis, spaced repetition, smart reminders, and exam topic progress tracking.",
      "q3": "What are learning objectives and why do I need them?",
      "a3": "Each subject in NIS (like math, physics) has clear learning objectives. We transform them into interactive tasks and quizzes, personalized lessons for each objective, and visual progress tracking for each topic. You always see exactly what you need to know and what level you're at.",
      "q4": "How does NIStego use AI in learning?",
      "a4": "We use Gemini API and other AI tools to analyze errors in tasks and tests, generate adaptive lessons, provide review recommendations, and offer hints and motivational reminders.",
      "q5": "Can I track my progress?",
      "a5": "Yes! You'll have a performance dashboard, progress bar for each quarter, topic and goal mastery graph, and history of attempts and revisions.",
      "q6": "How does NIStego help with motivation?",
      "a6": "We offer achievements and badges for completing goals, dynamics analysis (have you improved over the month?), support from an AI mentor with advice, praise, reminders, and smart planning with easy deadline control.",
      "q7": "Can my teacher see my progress?",
      "a7": "Yes, if you're connected to the school NIStego account. Teachers can see which objectives have been mastered, receive error reports, and assign tasks based on your gaps.",
      "q8": "Can I upload my grades?",
      "a8": "Yes. You can automatically pull grades from the school diary (in the future), enter them manually, attach scans, files, comments, and get analytics on scores (average score, dynamics, graphs).",
      "q9": "What happens if I don't understand a topic?",
      "a9": "The AI assistant will create a personalized lesson on this topic, show the mistakes you make most often, offer practice exercises, and add a reminder to review later (Spaced Repetition).",
      "q10": "Will materials be available in two languages?",
      "a10": "Yes. All lessons and goals are displayed in Russian, Kazakh (in development), with the ability to change the language in your profile.",
      "q11": "Can I use NIStego on my phone?",
      "a11": "Yes, the interface is fully responsive. In the future, we plan to release a mobile app with offline access to lessons and goal tracker.",
      "q12": "Can I compete with friends?",
      "a12": "Yes! There's a mode for 'Who will master the goal faster?', knowledge tournaments, and leaderboards among class, school, or the entire platform.",
      "q13": "How secure is my data?",
      "a13": "We use Firebase Auth with secure authorization, Firestore + Storage with restricted access, unique IDs tied only to your account, and only you decide who can see your progress.",
      "q14": "What if I change schools?",
      "a14": "You can continue using the platform as an independent student, export all your data and achievements, or customize it for a new curriculum if the school supports integration.",
      "q15": "Is NIStego only for NIS students?",
      "a15": "Initially, yes. But we're scaling the platform for regular school students, tutors, and for preparation for UNT/IELTS/SAT, etc."
